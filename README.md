Multi Step Prompt System

travel_planner.py contains the code for the prompt system. Since I was unable to upload python scripts, packages to the repo, I've decided to make a youtube video of it's working. 
The direct deployment of the app in streamlit cloud doesn't work due to missing packages and scripts.

Commands required:

#pip install streamlit google-generativeai openai.
#streamlit run travel_planner.py
